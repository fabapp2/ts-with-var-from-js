# Provide environment variables for a Typescript application

This example demonstrates the simplest way to provide environment specific variables
for a Typescript application.

* The file `src/global.vars` provides a default configuration
* The file `tsconfig.json` provides the typescript configuration
* Running a `tsc` command starts the transpilation and the generated javascript files will be placed in the `src` dir
* The `Ã¬ndex.html` imports the javascript files. The config file `global-vars.js` needs to be imported before the `index.js` file.
* When deploying the application you can replace the `global-vars.js` file with a environment specific file which defines the settings for your given environment.
